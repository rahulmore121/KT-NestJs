middleware is the function that get execute before the request handler(controller)

to implement middleware we dont have any property in @module  like import provider controller
we need to implement inside module class by impl
client -------------> middleware ---------> request handler (controller)

there are two types of middleware
1.module based (registered at module.ts file)
2.global based 


midldleware can be configured in two ways
1.function based
2.class based (used when dependency need to be injected) 



function middleware

function userAgent(req:Request,res:Response,next:NextFunction){
    request--->from client
    response--->sening to client
    next-->its a function which call the next middleware if there,else it calls to the request handler(chain)
}



if we want to make middleware global 

1. inside main.ts
 than we need to the middleware to be function not the class
2. inside app.module.ts
    than same implement nest module and configure ther
